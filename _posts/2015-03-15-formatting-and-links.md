Initially I thought the best way for me to learn frontend is to build my own website from scratch. While I still think that is a good idea, the time investment required meant that I didn't make much progress. Furthermore, what I was able to produce didn't look very good at all.

I still managed to learn a lot, but I am shifting my strategy to leverage frameworks to get my Portfolio generated. I can revist building something from scratch as a part of a smaller project.

So far my journey with using a Jekyll template has forced me to use WSL and Ruby. Ruby I had no experience with before so it has forced me to learn something new which is a good thing.

#### Current Goals

- deploy al-folio template site
- customize and/or remove default content
- add projects
